# Khmer Spellchecker and Grammar Checker: Model Recommendations and Architectural Approaches

## Executive Summary

Building an effective spellchecker and grammar checker for Khmer requires understanding the unique characteristics of the Khmer script and leveraging both traditional NLP techniques and modern deep learning approaches. This document outlines recommended architectures, methodologies, and implementation strategies specifically tailored for Khmer text processing.

## <CODE_REVIEW>

### Analysis of Current Subword Segmentation Implementation

**Strengths:**
- **Multiple Implementation Variants**: The codebase provides both regex-based and non-regex approaches, offering flexibility for performance optimization
- **Unicode-Aware Processing**: Proper handling of Khmer Unicode ranges (U+1780-U+17FF) with specialized character type checking
- **Comprehensive Character Support**: Handles consonants, vowels (independent/dependent), diacritics, subscript consonants (coeng), digits, and symbols
- **Performance Optimization**: The `khmer_syllables_no_regex_fast()` function uses direct Unicode code point checking instead of regex, which is more efficient for large text processing
- **Syllable Structure Awareness**: Correctly implements Khmer syllable patterns including complex subscript consonant combinations

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Inconsistent Method Naming**: Multiple similar functions (`khmer_syllables()`, `khmer_syllables_advanced()`, `khmer_syllables_no_regex()`) could be consolidated
- **Limited Error Handling**: No validation for malformed input or edge cases
- **Missing Documentation**: Some functions lack comprehensive docstrings explaining their specific use cases
- **Performance Metrics**: No benchmarking data to guide optimal method selection

**Suitability for Spellchecking:**
The current segmentation provides an excellent foundation for tokenization in a spellchecker, as it properly identifies syllable boundaries which are crucial for Khmer word formation analysis.

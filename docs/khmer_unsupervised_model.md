You can indeed build largely “unsupervised” Khmer spell- and grammar-checkers on top of subword models, and—even if you start from a non-Khmer pretrained model—use continued pre-training and fine-tuning to get very respectable performance. Here’s how:

---

## 1. Unsupervised/Error-Detection via Language Modeling

### 1.1. Subword-level LM for Anomaly Detection

1. **Train a subword LM** (e.g. a 4- or 5-layer Transformer encoder) on *clean* Khmer text, using the SentencePiece vocabulary you already built.
2. **At inference**, for each sentence:

   * Compute *token-level perplexities* (or negative log-probabilities) under the LM.
   * Mark any subword whose surprisal exceeds a threshold (e.g. 2 σ above mean) as a potential error.

   This is pure unsupervised detection—no labeled errors needed—and often catches typos (low-prob subwords) and even some grammatical oddities (unlikely sequences).

### 1.2. Denoising Auto-Encoder for Correction

1. **Create synthetic noise** on your clean corpus: randomly

   * delete or swap subwords,
   * substitute a subword by a random neighbor in embedding-space,
   * drop diacritics.
2. **Train a seq2seq denoiser** (Transformer encoder–decoder) to reconstruct the original from the noisy input.
3. **At inference**, feed in real Khmer sentences: the model will attempt to “clean” them, auto-correcting many spelling mistakes and simple word-order glitches.

This “noisy‐channel” approach is fully unsupervised (you generate your own training pairs) and works at subword granularity.

## 2. Leveraging a Non-Khmer Pretrained Model

You don’t have to start your Khmer checker from scratch. Here are two strategies:

### 2.1. Continue Pre-training a Multilingual Model

* **Select** a multilingual Transformer (e.g. mBERT, XLM-R) that *does* include Khmer (if you’re lucky) or that was trained with a SentencePiece vocab you can extend.
* **Extend the tokenizer**: merge in your Khmer SentencePiece model (or simply append your new subword tokens), randomly initializing their embeddings.
* **Continue MLM pre-training** on your large Khmer corpus (no labels!) until the model learns Khmer statistics.
* Then use that model for the detection (as in 1.1) and/or fine-tune it as a denoising autoencoder (as in 1.2).

### 2.2. Adapter-Based Fine-Tuning

If you prefer to leave the large multilingual weights intact:

1. **Freeze** the base model.
2. **Inject lightweight adapters** (bottleneck layers) into each Transformer block.
3. **Train only the adapters** on your Khmer corpus with the MLM and/or denoising objectives.

Adapters let you leverage all the general linguistic knowledge in the parent model, while adding Khmer-specific capacities with only a few million extra parameters.

## 3. Putting It All Together

1. **Preprocess** your data with your Khmer subword splitter.
2. **Unsupervised LM** for fast, high-precision *detection* of out-of-vocabulary or improbable subwords.
3. **Denoising seq2seq** for *correction* of spelling and simple grammar (word-order, missing particles).
4. **(Optional) Minimal supervised fine-tuning**

   * Collect a small set (even a few thousand) of real error–correction pairs.
   * Fine-tune your denoiser on that to boost quality further.
5. **Deploy** as a pipeline or joint model: first flag with the LM, then auto-correct with the seq2seq, and finally re-rank suggestions by your LM score.

### Why This Works

* **No large annotated Khmer treebanks** needed—you generate your own noise or simply use language modeling on clean text.
* **Cross-lingual transfer** from existing multilingual models gives you a head-start, even if their original training didn’t focus on Khmer.
* **Subword granularity** naturally handles OOV tokens, diacritics, and compounding, which are crucial in Khmer orthography.

With this approach you’ll have a fully unsupervised or weakly-supervised Khmer spell- and grammar-checker that can be further refined with small amounts of labeled data as it becomes available.

# Unsupervised Approaches for Khmer Spellchecker and Grammar Checker

## Executive Summary

Building a Khmer spellchecker and grammar checker **without labeled data** is not only feasible but often **more practical** than supervised approaches, especially for low-resource languages like Khmer. This document outlines proven unsupervised methodologies that can achieve high accuracy by leveraging the existing syllable segmentation and large amounts of unlabeled Khmer text.

## Why Unsupervised Approaches Are Ideal for Khmer

### **Advantages:**
- **No Annotation Required**: Eliminates expensive manual labeling process
- **Scalable Data Collection**: Can use millions of words from web sources
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Learns from real usage patterns in native content
- **Rapid Deployment**: Faster to implement and iterate
- **Cost-Effective**: No need for expert linguist annotations

### **Khmer-Specific Benefits:**
- **Limited Labeled Data**: Very few annotated Khmer error correction datasets exist
- **Script Complexity**: Unsupervised methods can learn complex diacritic patterns naturally
- **Regional Variations**: Can adapt to different Khmer dialects and writing styles
- **Mixed Content**: Handles Khmer-English code-switching common in modern usage

## Recommended Unsupervised Architectures

### 1. **Statistical Language Model Approach** (Highest ROI)

#### **A. Character-Level N-gram Models**
**Purpose**: Detect unusual character sequences that likely indicate errors

**Implementation Strategy:**
```
Training: Large Khmer corpus → Character 3-grams, 4-grams, 5-grams → 
Frequency tables → Probability distributions

Detection: Input text → Character sequences → Probability scores → 
Low probability = potential error
```

**Khmer-Specific Advantages:**
- Learns valid diacritic combinations automatically
- Detects missing or misplaced coeng markers
- Identifies impossible vowel-consonant sequences
- Handles subscript consonant patterns

**Example Detection Cases:**
- `ក្ុំ` (impossible: coeng + vowel) → Low probability
- `ករណី` (correct sequence) → High probability
- `ព្រំុ` (too many vowels) → Low probability

#### **B. Syllable-Level Statistical Models**
**Purpose**: Validate syllable structure using your existing segmentation

**Training Process:**
1. **Corpus Collection**: Gather clean Khmer text (news, literature, websites)
2. **Syllable Extraction**: Use your `khmer_syllables_no_regex_fast()` function
3. **Frequency Analysis**: Build syllable frequency tables
4. **Pattern Learning**: Learn valid syllable structures

**Validation Rules:**
- **Frequency Threshold**: Syllables below threshold are suspicious
- **Structure Validation**: Check against Khmer phonological rules
- **Context Patterns**: Learn which syllables commonly appear together

#### **C. Word-Level Frequency Models**
**Purpose**: Identify out-of-vocabulary or misspelled words

**Implementation:**
- Build comprehensive Khmer word frequency lists from large corpora
- Use edit distance (Levenshtein) for correction suggestions
- Weight corrections by word frequency and edit distance

### 2. **Rule-Based Phonological Validation**

#### **A. Khmer Syllable Structure Rules**
**Purpose**: Validate syllables against Khmer linguistic rules

**Core Khmer Syllable Pattern:**
```
(C)(subscript-C)(V)(final-C)(diacritic)
where:
- C = Consonant (required for most syllables)
- subscript-C = Coeng + Consonant (optional, can be multiple)
- V = Vowel (dependent or independent)
- final-C = Final consonant (optional)
- diacritic = Tone marks, signs (optional)
```

**Validation Rules:**
1. **Coeng Validation**: Coeng (U+17D2) must be followed by consonant
2. **Vowel Placement**: Dependent vowels must follow consonants
3. **Diacritic Order**: Specific order for multiple diacritics
4. **Impossible Combinations**: Detect phonologically invalid sequences

#### **B. Unicode Sequence Validation**
**Purpose**: Ensure correct Unicode character ordering

**Validation Checks:**
- Proper placement of combining characters
- Valid character sequence according to Unicode normalization
- Detection of isolated dependent vowels
- Identification of malformed subscript sequences

### 3. **Self-Supervised Neural Approaches**

#### **A. Character-Level Language Model**
**Model**: LSTM/GRU or small Transformer trained on character prediction

**Training Strategy:**
```
Input: "អ្នកគ្រួបង្រៀនភាសាខ្មែ" → 
Target: "្នកគ្រួបង្រៀនភាសាខ្មែរ" (next character prediction)
```

**Error Detection:**
- High perplexity indicates potential errors
- Beam search for correction suggestions
- Confidence thresholding for error flagging

#### **B. Masked Language Modeling (BERT-style)**
**Architecture**: Small transformer trained on Khmer corpus with masking

**Training Process:**
1. **Tokenization**: Use your syllable segmentation as tokenizer
2. **Masking**: Randomly mask 15% of syllables
3. **Prediction**: Train model to predict masked syllables
4. **Fine-tuning**: No labeled data needed - self-supervised

**Error Detection:**
- Low prediction confidence for original syllable = potential error
- High-confidence alternatives = correction suggestions

### 4. **Dictionary and Frequency-Based Approaches**

#### **A. Comprehensive Dictionary Building**
**Sources for Khmer Dictionaries:**
- **Chuon Nath Dictionary**: Classical Khmer reference
- **Modern Dictionaries**: Contemporary usage patterns
- **Web Scraping**: News sites, Wikipedia, social media
- **Government Documents**: Official terminology
- **Academic Papers**: Technical vocabulary

**Dictionary Enhancement:**
- **Inflection Generation**: Create word variants systematically
- **Compound Recognition**: Identify compound word patterns
- **Proper Noun Lists**: Names, places, organizations

#### **B. Edit Distance Correction**
**Algorithm**: Weighted Levenshtein distance with Khmer-specific costs

**Khmer-Specific Edit Costs:**
- **Low Cost**: Similar-looking characters (ក vs គ)
- **Medium Cost**: Same consonant class substitutions
- **High Cost**: Vowel additions/deletions
- **Very High Cost**: Coeng-related errors
